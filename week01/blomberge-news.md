# China Basks in Covid Vindication as Omicron Closes Borders

 Countries across the world `scrambled` this week to `impose` border and travel `curbs` after the new omicron `variant` `emerged`. In China, it was business as usual

 While scientists race to figure out whether the Covid-19 variant first `sequenced` in South Africa will `pose` a bigger problem than the highly `infectious` delta `strain`, countries ranging from the U.K. and Israel to Japan `erred` on the side of caution. They put in place `preemptive` defenses and travel restrictions designed to keep the variant out, rather than `betting` on omicron `being a flash in the pan`. It’s a `calculus` Beijing didn’t have to consider.

 The emergence of the highly-mutated form of the virus has provided some `vindication` for China’s Covid Zero approach, which saw the country close its border `indefinitely` at the beginning of the pandemic, and `intensify` its `stringent` curbs ever since. While other places `pivot` to living alongside the virus, China has `prioritized` weeding out every last infection, saying the health of the population is its main priority -- and economic benefits will follow.

## Covid Booster
 “`Omicron is a booster shot for Covid Zero`,” said Huang Yanzhong, a senior `fellow` for global health at the New York-based `Council` on Foreign Relations. “If Western countries are walking back on their reopening and closing borders, they’ll lose the grounds for `accusing` China of sticking to what they say is an unsustainable and incorrect approach.”

 Other countries embracing travel and border restrictions anew raises questions about whether China’s strategy may offer a better defense from newly emerging variants, particularly `in the early days` when their risk isn’t fully understood and the `guarantee` of an exit from the Covid pandemic `is far from certain`. The country’s state-backed newspaper, the Global Times, already declared China the most likely place to avoid `devastation` from omicron.

 While the `verdict` is still out on whether the `startling` `genetic` changes found in omicron justify the `preemptive` hankering down, some analysts said China’s approach may offer benefits. Kinger Lau, a strategist with `Goldman Sachs Group Inc`, said the economic `fundamental`s and ongoing Covid `curbs` in the world’s second largest economy put it in a better position to face the new variant. 

 Still, the zero-tolerance strategy China is `cling`ing to has come under growing criticism from abroad and at least partly from within, and goes well beyond `rigid` border closures to include a growing suite of `disruptive` curbs. 

## Harder Containment

The infectious delta variant tied to more `flareups` in China

While it has `shield`ed the world’s most populous country from the `rampant` infections and massive death tolls that have `ravaged` other parts of the world, Covid Zero has taxed China and its people, with the `weekslong` `quarantines` and re-entry `procedures` meaning they’re effectively locked inside the country. 

It’s gotten harder, and less successful, over time. The handful of delta flareups that have emerged since May are requiring ever-more `stringent` measures to `subdue`. China is currently grappling with dozens of infections in a border town in its Inner Mongolia region, even as remnants of a previous outbreak continue to linger.

After vowing to keep out Covid, China doesn’t have many options. The country’s approach is a one-size-fits-all strategy, said Nicholas Thomas, an associate professor at the City University of Hong Kong who has edited several books on foreign policy and public health. The lack of efficient vaccines gives China little room to maneuver, he said. 

firms Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech Ltd. are less effective at preventing symptomatic infections than Western mRNA shots in studies, though they slashed hospitalization rates and deaths. Still, relatively little solid data on how these shots work against the delta variant has been published compared to their rivals in the West.

That’s one reason why China continues to double down on its zero-tolerance approach rather than rely on vaccination rates that top 75% of the population, cover children as young as three, and include widespread use of booster shots. It doesn’t have much confidence in what would happen if it eased those curbs, analysts say.
